# MMRDA Internship: Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my 2-week internship at the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). During this internship, I analyzed multiple datasets, performed exploratory data analysis, and built machine learning models using basic algorithms.

## Datasets Analyzed and Models Developed

- **Black Friday Sale Dataset**: Sales analysis to uncover consumer spending trends.
- **Boston House Price Dataset**: Regression models to predict house prices based on features.
- **Census Income Dataset**: Classification models to predict income levels using demographic data.
- **Crime Dataset**: Location-based crime prediction and crime pattern analysis.
- **Human Activity Dataset**: Classification of human activities using sensor data.
- **Iris Dataset**: Classification models for predicting iris flower species.
- **Titanic Dataset**: Survival predictions using classification models.
- **Walmart Dataset**: Sales forecasting and identifying key factors affecting store performance.
- **Whatâ€™s Cooking Dataset**: Cuisine type prediction based on recipe ingredients.
- **Wine Quality Dataset**: Classification models to predict wine quality based on chemical properties.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- **Regression Models**: Linear regression and decision tree regression.
- **Classification Models**: Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Clustering Techniques**: K-Means Clustering (where applicable).

## Skills Gained

- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Basic understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
